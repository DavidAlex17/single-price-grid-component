## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

i learned how to use grid with the minimal knowledge i have with grid. i decided to make the code with grid style because of its title-why not. overall i believe i did pretty good with it. i am also getting pretty good with using pseudo code, although i might have added to much but at least its ingrained in my head now.

### Continued development

For continued development i plan on working more with grid, it is critical i know it from the back of my head. i admit i am foggy about the little concepts such as margins and padding and the box model, so far i have been playing the guessing game however, i hope with the consistent practice it'll click eventually.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped me for understanding the definitions of certain css selectors or properties.
